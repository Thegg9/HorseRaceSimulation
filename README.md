# Horse Race Simulator

This project implements a complete Horse Race Simulator in two parts:

- **Part 1:** Textual Racing Simulator (Console-based application)
- **Part 2:** Graphical Racing Simulator (JavaFX GUI application)

Both parts allow users to design tracks, customize horses, simulate races, place virtual bets, and track performance statistics.
